      "text": "After becoming a mom, I sought physical well-being through yoga. Years later, my 200-hour teacher training opened my eyes to yoga's deeper aspects – meditation, breathwork, and self-awareness. This inward focus sparked a transformation, bringing yoga off the mat and into my daily life. Restorative yoga became a haven, quieting my mind and body, and teaching me deep relaxation.",
