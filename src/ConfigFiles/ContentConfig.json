Years later, my 200-hour teacher training opened my eyes to yoga's deeper aspects â€“ meditation, breathwork, and self-awareness. This inward focus sparked a transformation, bringing yoga off the mat and into my daily life. Restorative yoga became a haven, quieting my mind and body, and teaching me deep relaxation.",
