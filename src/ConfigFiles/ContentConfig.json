        "text": "After the birth of my first son, I began attending yoga classes to enhance my physical health and flexibility. Nonetheless, it took me several years to realize that yoga was more than just practicing physical asana postures. It was during my 200-hour teacher training that I learned about the 8 limbs of yoga. My training introduced me to the practices of meditation, breath awareness, and the concepts of Yamas and Niyamas. This is where I started to awaken to my true state of being through this inward focus. I began to bring yoga off the mat and into my daily life. I soon discovered the benefits of Restorative Yoga, which helped quiet my hyperactive ADHD body and brain and began to heal my nervous system from years of stress. Through my Restorative Yoga practice, I learned how to consciously rest and turn my attention inward without judgment.",
